    <section class="Explain">
        <li>Developing the ability to read and write well</li>
        <li>Developing the tendency to read and write well</li>
        <li>Developing academic knowledge to become ‘good at school’</li>
        <li>Entirely mastering a given curriculum of study</li>
        <li>Mastering and then applying academic and non-academic 
            knowledge to live (e.g., to ‘get a job’–which is different than ‘doing good work’)</li>
        <li>Gaining and using academic knowledge to do good work</li>
        <li>The ability to expertly create your own ‘curriculum’–learning 
            literacy–this being hugely superior to mastering a given curriculum</li>
        <li>Developing and nurturing your creative capacities</li>
        <li>Developing the ability to think rationally and critically 
            (to evaluate what you see and hear and read and separate truth from non-truths, for example)</li>
        <li>Developing the tendency to think critically</li>
        <li>Developing critical literacy (which requires both academic knowledge, 
            creative expression, and critical thinking) in non-native places and developing critical 
            literacy in one’s native place (e.g., protecting resources or rebalancing inequalities)</li>
        <li>Developing the ability to think and feel with and alongside others</li>
        <li>Developing and applying critical literacy (i.e., to do good work–helping people, 
            restoring places, promoting equitable well-being, etc., which requires the 
            ability to think and feel with and alongside others) in service of a given place and its people</li>
        <li>Developing the ability to ask and think about ‘great questions’ through sustained inquiry and curiosity</li>
        <li>Developing the ability to think (which requires critical literacy as well as the ability 
            to ask great questions) and work with the people and places of a connected world</li>
        <li>Developing the tendency to work well (which requires critical literacy, 
            empathy, and affection) with the people and places of a connected world</li>
